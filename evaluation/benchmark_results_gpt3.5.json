Since their inception, Transformers have outperformed many traditional neural network architectures due to their \"self-attention\" mechanism and their scalability across various applications. In this paper, we cover the use of Transformers in Robotics. We go through recent advances and trends in Transformer architectures and examine their integration into robotic perception, planning, and control for autonomous systems. Furthermore, we review past work and recent research on use of Transformers in Robotics as pre-trained foundation models and integration of Transformers with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for autonomous systems. We discuss how different Transformer variants are being adapted in robotics for reliable planning and perception, increasing human-robot interaction, long-horizon decision-making, and generalization. Finally, we address limitations and challenges, offering insight and suggestions for future research directions.\nComments: | Early preprint, focusing primarily on general purpose robots, more updates to come\n---|---\nSubjects: |  Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)\nCite as: | [arXiv:2412.10599](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10599) [cs.RO]\n| (or  [arXiv:2412.10599v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10599v1) [cs.RO] for this version)\n|  <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.10599> Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\n## Submission history\nFrom: Nikunj Sanghai [[view email](/show-email/33ee6d07/2412.10599)]\n**[v1]** Fri, 13 Dec 2024 23:02:15 UTC (801 KB)\nFull-text links:\n## Access Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Advances in Transformers for Robotic Applications: A Review, by Nikunj Sanghai and Nik Bear Brown\n* [View PDF](/pdf/2412.10599)\n* [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.10599v1)\n* [TeX Source ](/src/2412.10599)\n[view license](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/ \"Rights to this article\")\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\n[< prev](/prevnext?id=2412.10599&function=prev&context=cs.RO \"previous in cs.RO \\(accesskey p\\)\") |  [next >](/prevnext?id=2412.10...\n[Content truncated]\n",

In our case, we are using the GPT-2 model with 345 million parameters or weights\"`. So are the 175 billion \"parameters\" just neural weights? Why then are they called parameters? [GPT3's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) shows that there are only 96 layers, so I'm assuming it's not a very deep network, but extremely fat. Or does it mean that each \"parameter\" is just a representation of the encoders or decoders?\n[](https://i.sstatic.net/dthvC.png)\nAn excerpt from [this website](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/) shows tokens:\n> In this case, there are two additional parameters that can be passed to gpt2.generate(): truncate and include_prefix. For example, if each short text begins with a <|startoftext|> token and ends with a <|endoftext|>, then setting prefix='<|startoftext|>', truncate=<|endoftext|>', and include_prefix=False, and length is sufficient, then gpt-2-simple will automatically extract the shortform texts, even when generating in batches.\nSo are the parameters various kinds of tokens that are manually created by humans who try to fine-tune the models? Still, 175 billion such fine-tuning parameters is too high for humans to create, so I assume the \"parameters\" are auto-generated somehow.\nThe [attention-based](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) paper mentions the [query-key-value weight](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/) matrices as the \"parameters\". **Even if it is these weights, I'd just like to know what kind of a process generates these parameters, who chooses the parameters and specifies the relevance of words?

And how can one calculate the number of parameters from the architecture\u2019s \u201csize hyperparameters\u201d like dimensionality and number of layers?\nThe goal of this post is to answer those questions, and make sense of this nice table from the GPT-3 paper, deriving the n_params column from the other columns.\n[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOte!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F033bb304-9940-4cbd-b636-305438251b57_1626x670.png)Most of Table 2.1 from the GPT-3 paper. How can we derive the number of parameters from the \u201csize hyperparameters\u201d (rightmost columns)?\nSubscribe\n## Primary Sources\nLots of resources about transformers conjure information from thin air, and I want to avoid that, so I\u2019m showing all my work here.

Here\u2019s a look at the best ones this year.\nPython was released in 1991 and is one of the most widely used programming languages today [[1](https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/blog/most-in-demand-programming-languages)]. It\u2019s efficient and easy to learn, and one of its greatest features is its open-source libraries available for users. The libraries allow users to choose from frameworks that they can build off of to produce new [machine learning (ML) models](https://www.coursera.org/articles/machine-learning-models).\nWhether you're already familiar with machine learning in your career or want to get started, this field holds plenty of growth opportunities. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) expects jobs in the field will grow much faster than the rate of all jobs in the US [[2](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm)].\nIn this article, you'll learn more about Python libraries and explore nine that are best for machine learning.

One of the most common questions we hear is, \u201cWhich programming language should I learn first?\u201d\nThe answer is: It depends. As Web Developer Pat DePuydt explains in the video below, the tech industry changes fast. And with over 600 possible languages to choose from, it can feel daunting to find the one that best suits your needs.\nStill, it basically comes down to what you\u2019re looking to achieve. Here, we\u2019ll explore some of the most popular languages (and their uses) so that you\u2019ll have a better idea of which one is right for you.\nBut, before we dive into different programming languages, let\u2019s first address some common questions.\n## What are programming languages?\n[Programming languages](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=camp~general_content_marketing~prod~All~geo~All~aud~General~funn_Awareness~msg~Brand_Awareness~cont~Blog_Post~sited~Blog_Post~time~Evergreen~&utm_content=what_programming_lang_should_i_learn) are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow. Computers think in binary, and programming languages help us translate 1s and 0s into code that humans can understand.\nProgrammers are the ambassadors between the worlds of humans and computers, and programming languages are the tools they use to tell computers what to do.\n## Learn something new for free\n* [Intro to ChatGPT](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intro-to-chatgpt?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=learn_something_new)\n* [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=learn_something_new)\n## Is it possible to choose the \u201cwrong\u201d programming language?\nNew developers often hesitate before picking up a programming language, fearing they\u2019ll waste time and energy learning something they\u2019ll never use. But the truth is, there\u2019s really no such thing as picking the \u201cwrong\u201d language. No matter which language you choose, you\u2019ll still be learning valuable skills.\nProgramming languages may look different on the surface, but they have a lot in common. They share similar patterns and structures, and by learning one language, you\u2019ll be introduced to key coding concepts that\u2019ll help you learn other languages in the future. Once you pick up your first programming language \u2014 no matter which you choose \u2014 it\u2019ll be easier to pick others up.\nPlus, it\u2019s not uncommon for developers to move between different languages throughout their careers as they\u2019re asked to solve different sorts of problems. You\u2019re definitely not locked into using the first programming language you choose. So don\u2019t worry too much about focusing on whether you\u2019re learning the \u201cbest\u201d programming language. Instead, focus on gaining that foundational knowledge with whatever language you choose.\n## What programming language should I learn?\nNow that you\u2019ve got some b...\n[Content truncated]\n",

C/C++\n2. JavaScript\n3. R\n4. Swift\n5. PHP\n6. Go/Golang\n7. MATLAB\n8. C#\n9. Kotlin\n## Low-level vs. high-level language: Understanding the levels of programming\nBefore we dive in, you need to understand [how programming languages are classified](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-high-level-language-and-low-level-language#).\n**Low-level languages** are also known as machine code. They\u2019re designed to be easy for machines to understand \u2014 which, in practice, means they\u2019re expressed in [binary code](https://programmerbay.com/difference-between-high-level-language-and-low-level-language/#). Each low-level language is designed for one type of processor and is tailored to the capabilities and specifications of that processor.\nA **high-level language** is user-oriented; it\u2019s designed to be easy for humans to understand, so everything is written in normal human language. That means you can give instructions using everyday words \u2014 for example, you\u2019ll see Python programmers using words like \u201cinput,\u201d \u201ctotal,\u201d and \u201ccount\u201d to tell the machine what to do. High-level language needs to be run through a compiler or translator to make it readable by a machine. It\u2019s also much less memory-efficient than low-level languages.\nNow, let\u2019s dive into the top programming languages for 2022.\n## C/C++: One of the most popular programming languages in 2022\n**Difficulty level**\nHard\n**Future job prospects**\n* Junior or senior programmer\n* Software d...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 3: What Are the Top Programming Languages to Learn in 2022?\nURL: https://www.logicmonitor.com/blog/what-are-the-top-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2022\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent:\nError fetching URL: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.logicmonitor.com/blog/what-are-the-top-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2022\n",

When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread (as well as whether the work was completed or failed). There are numerous benefits to using it, such as improved application performance and enhanced responsiveness.\nBut, like all things in programming, it\u2019s not something that you should use in every instance; in fact, there are some situations in which you should avoid it. Asynchronous programming has actually been around for a long time, but in recent years, it\u2019s become more widely used. According to Mike James at iProgrammer, \u201cOften the programmer is fully aware that what they are doing is object oriented but only vaguely aware that they are writing asynchronous code.\u201d So, we set out to identify the best use cases for async as well as situations in which you shouldn\u2019t use it. We searched the web for insights and reached out to a panel of programmers and asked them to answer this question:\n## \u201cWhat are some examples of situations where programmers use asynchronous programming but shouldn\u2019t (or areas where they don\u2019t but probably should)?\u201d\n### Meet Our Panel of Expert Programmers:\n* James McCarthy\n* Calvin Brown\n* Kevin Ng\n* Lindsey Havens\n* Manu Singh\n* Steve Silberberg\n* Max Galka\n|\n* Peter Tasker\n* Ashish Datta\n* Johannes Kadak\n* Microsoft Developer Network\n* Mark Patterson\n* Brown University Computer Science Program\n|\n* Maria Yakimova\n* Brij Bhushan Mishra\n* Eric Vogel\n* Peter Olson\n* Joy George Kunjikkuru\n* Sathyaish Chakravarthy\n* Richard Rodgers\n---|---|---\nLearn more about the ideal use cases for asynchronous programming by reading what our experts had to say below.\n* * *\n### James McCarthy\nJames is a serial web entrepreneur who builds websites with the aim of helping millions of people.

Say the second of the three is a big network request that could take a lot of time, whereas tasks 1 and 3 are fairly simple tasks that will be executed instantly. Wouldn't it be best to write it synchronously as 1-3-2, that way even if task 2 takes time it's still non-blocking?\nIt's all slowly clicking in my head but that scenario just keeps appearing in my head.\nRegardless of that hypothetical, I can't FULLY get why I would use Async, if that makes sense?\nSorry for a simple question, I asked on StackOverflow and got some pretty unhelpful responses so I thought this would be a good idea instead.

Asynchronous programming is a form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread. It offers benefits such as improved application performance and enhanced responsiveness. However, it is essential to use asynchronous programming judiciously and in the appropriate situations.\n\nHere are some key points from the search results:\n1. Asynchronously updating records that are dependent or depended upon is generally not recommended as it can lead to data becoming out of sync. Simple processing of independent data is a suitable use case for asynchronous programming and can provide better user experience and performance in applications.\n2. Asynchronous programming should not be used in every instance, and there are situations where it should be avoided. It is crucial to understand the best use cases for asynchronous programming and when not to use it.\n3. Asynchronous programming has become more widely used in recent years, and it is essential to be aware of its benefits and limitations.\n\nIn summary, studying asynchronous programming before work can help you grasp the concepts and principles, while studying it after work can allow you to practice and apply these concepts in practical scenarios. It is advisable to gain a good understanding of asynchronous programming and its use cases to effectively utilize it in your development projects.",

Whether you\u2019re using Java\u2019s `CompletableFuture`, JavaScript\u2019s `async/await`, or Python\u2019s `asyncio`, mistakes in async code can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hard-to-debug errors.

From \u201cwhy is this running in order A-D-C-B?\u201d to \u201cwhy did my server freeze?\u201d, the same mistakes show up again and again across codebases.\nThis guide is your **field manual**. We\u2019ll walk through the most common async mistakes (frontend + Node), why they happen, and exactly how to fix them \u2014 with **tiny utilities** , **clear patterns** , and **real-world examples** (React, fetch, Node I/O). Keep this tab open the next time an async bug wastes your afternoon.\n* * *\n### 1) Mistake: Thinking `await` blocks the thread\n**What devs expect**\nconsole.log('A');\nawait doThing();  // \u201cblocks, right?\u201d\nconsole.log('B');\n**What actually happens**\n`await` **yields** the current async function. The function returns a **Promise** and continues **later** on a **microtask** when the awaited promise settles. The thread is free to do other work.\n**Why it hurts**\n* Logs happen \u201cout of order.\u201d\n* UI jank when you rely on `await` to \u201cpause\u201d rendering.\n* Surprise reentrancy (event handlers firing in between).\n**Fix**\nAdopt the mental model: `**await**`**= \u201cpause and resume later on a microtask.\u201d** If you must delay \u201cjust after this,\u201d use a microtask explicitly:\nawait Promise.resolve(); // yield 1 tick before continuing\n* * *\n### 2) Mistake: Forgetting to `return` inside `.then`\n// \u274c WRONG: doB is unchained; the next then runs too early\ndoA()\n.then(a => { doB(a); })\n.then(useB);\n**Fix**\n// \u2705 return the promise (or value)\ndoA()\n.then(a => doB(a))\n.then(useB)\n.catch(handle);\n**Why**\n`.then` **always returns a new promise** whose resolution is **whatever you return**. If you forget to return, the next link sees `undefined` and may run before the inner async work finishes.\n* * *\n### 3) Mistake: Using `forEach` with `async` callbacks\n// \u274c .forEach ignores returned promises\nitems.forEach(async item => {\nawait save(item);\n});\nconsole.log('Done'); // prints before saves finish\n**Fix**\nUse `for...of` for sequential work, or `Promise.all` for parallel work.\n// Sequential\nfor (const item of items) {\nawait save(item);\n}\n// Parallel\nawait Promise.all(items.map(save));\n**Rule of thumb**\n* **Sequential dependency** \u2192 `for...of` \\+ `await`\n* **Independent tasks** \u2192 kick them all off \u2192 `Promise.all`\n* * *\n### 4) Mistake: Accidental serialization\n// \u274c Unintended: runs one by one\nconst results = [];\nfor (const url of urls) {\nresults.push(await fet...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 3: Day 26: 6 Common Mistakes with JavaScript Promises &amp; Async Code\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_zcXUz1neo\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent:\n[](/ \"YouTube\")[](/ \"YouTube\")\n[About](https://www.youtube.com/about/)[Press](https://www.youtube.com/about/press/)[Copyright](https://www.youtube.com/about/copyright/)[Contact us](/t/contact_us/)[Creators](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)[Advertise](https://www.youtube.com/ads/)[Developers](https://developers.google.com/youtube)[Terms](/t/terms)[Privacy](/t/privacy)[Policy & Safety](https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/)[How YouTube works](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks?utm_campaign=ytgen&utm_source=ythp&utm_medium=LeftNav&utm_content=txt&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fhowyoutubeworks%3Futm_source%3Dythp%26utm_medium%3DLeftNav%26utm_campaign%3Dytgen)[Test new features](/new)[NFL Sunday Ticket](https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket)\n\u00a9 2025 Google LLC\n",

You can also write asynchronous code for CPU-bound scenarios like expensive calculations.\nC# has a language-level asynchronous programming model that allows you to easily write asynchronous code without having to juggle callbacks or conform to a library that supports asynchrony. The model follows what is known as the [Task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP)](../../standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap).\n## Explore the asynchronous programming model\nThe `Task` and `Task<T>` objects represent the core of asynchronous programming. These objects are used to model asynchronous operations by supporting the `async` and `await` keywords. In most cases, the model is fairly simple for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound scenarios. Inside an `async` method:\n* **I/O-bound code** starts an operation represented by a `Task` or `Task<T>` object within the `async` method.\n* **CPU-bound code** starts an operation on a background thread with the [Task.Run](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.run) method.\nIn both cases, an active `Task` represents an asynchronous operation that might not be complete.\nThe `await` keyword is where the magic happens. It yields control to the caller of the method that contains the `await` expression, and ultimately allows the UI to be responsive or a service to be elastic. While [there are ways](../../standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap) to approach asynchronous code other than by using the `async` and `await` expressions, this article focuses on the language-level constructs.\nNote\nSome examples presented in this article use the [System.Net.Http.HttpClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) class to download data from a web service. In the example code, the `s_httpClient` object is a static field of type `Program` class:\n`private static readonly HttpClient s_httpClient = new();`\nFor more information, see the complete example code at the end of this article.\n### Review underlying concepts\nWhen you implement asynchronous programming in your C# code, the compiler transforms your program into a state machine. This construct tracks various operations and state in your code, such as yielding execution when the code reaches an `await` expression, and resuming exec...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 2: Understanding Async Programming in JavaScript \u2014 with real-world examples\nURL: https://stackdevflow.com/posts/understanding-async-programming-in-javascript-with-real-world-examples-rvka\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent:\nSkip to content\nUnderstanding Async Programming in JavaScript \u2014 with real-world examples | StackDevFlow\n#asyncprogramming#javascript#fullstack#webdevelopment#asyncawait\n# Understanding Async Programming in JavaScript \u2014 with real-world examples\nSanjay Singh\nSep 5, 20258 min read44 views5 likes\nFollow Report user\nFollowReport user\nAsync programming is one of those things every JavaScript developer must get comfortable with.

Async programming lets us start work and get notified later when it\u2019s done \u2014 so the app stays responsive.\n**Common async tasks:**\n* HTTP requests (fetch, axios)\n* Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)\n* File I/O (Node fs)\n* Streams and workers\n* * *\n## **1) Quick primer: the event loop (what actually happens)**\nThis tiny snippet demonstrates a crucial ordering detail:\nconsole.log('start');\nsetTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);\nPromise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));\nconsole.log('end');\nOutput:\nstart\nend\npromise\ntimeout\n**Why?**\n1. Synchronous code runs first (start, end).\n2. Resolved promises go to the microtask queue (higher priority).\n3. setTimeout callbacks go to the macrotask queue (next tick).\nSo **microtasks** (promises) run before macrotasks (setTimeout), even if timeout is 0.\n* * *\n## **2\\. Callbacks: the old school (and callback hell)**\nCallbacks work, but nesting them creates unreadable code.\ndoSomething(arg, (err, res) => {\nif (err) return handle(err);\ndoMore(res, (err2, res2) => {\nif (err2) return handle(err2);\ndoEvenMore(res2, (err3, res3) => {\n// you see the spiral...\n});\n});\n});\nProblems:\n* Hard to read and reason about\n* Error handling is clunky\n* Hard to compose\n* * *\n## **3\\. Promises \u2014 a huge improvement**\nCreate and use promises:\nfunction wait(ms) {\nreturn new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n}\nwait(1000).then(() => console.log('1 second passed'));\nPromise chaining:\nfetch('/api/user')\n.then(res => res.json())\n.then(user => fetch(`/api/profile/${user.id}`))\n.then(res => res.json())\n.then(profile => console.log(profile))\n.catch(err => console.error('Something failed', err));\n**Important** : .catch() at the end handles any error in the chain.\n* * *\n## 4\\. async / await \u2014 write async like sync\nasync / await is syntax sugar that makes promise-based code easier to write and read.\nasync function loadProfile() {\ntry {\nconst userRes = await fetch('/api/user');\nconst user = await userRes.json();\nconst profileR...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 3: Async/await and Tasks explained with code example | Medium\nURL: https://medium.com/@codebob75/parallel-and-asynchronous-computing-in-c-net-using-tasks-and-async-await-065695c17e82\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent:\n[Sitemap](/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\n[Open in app](https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F065695c17e82&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderUser&%7Estage=mobileNavBar&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\nSign up\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40codebob75%2Fparallel-and-asynchronous-computing-in-c-net-using-tasks-and-async-await-065695c17e82&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n[Medium Logo](/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\n[Write](/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------------------)\n[Search](/search?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\nSign up\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40codebob75%2Fparallel-and-asynchronous-computing-in-c-net-using-tasks-and-async-await-065695c17e82&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n# Parallel and asynchronous Computing in C#/ .Net using tasks and async/await\n[](/@codebob75?source=post_page---byline--065695c17e82---------------------------------------)\n[Bob Code](/@codebob75?source=post_page---byline--065695c17e82---------------------------------------)\n35 min read\n\u00b7\nJun 14, 2024\n[](/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Fp%2F065695c17e82&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40codebob75%2Fparallel-and-asynchronous-computing-in-c-net-using-tasks-and-async-await-065695c17e82&user=Bob+Code&userId=37f4a5954bc4&source=---header_actions--065695c17e82---------------------clap_footer------------------)\n\\--\n1\n[](/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F065695c17e82&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40codebob75%2Fparallel-and-asynchronous-computing-in-c-net-using-tasks-and-async-await-065695c17e82&source=---header_actions--065695c17e82---------------------bookmark_footer------------------)\nListen\nShare\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nBob Code Originals\nThis is a sequel to my post on Multithreading in C# where I also introduce Asynchrony and parallelism are and when to use each.\n## [Multithreading in C#/.Net Introduction and Best practicesThreads c#/Net how and when to work with themmedium.com](/@codebob75/multithreading-in-c-net-introduction-and-best-practices-fe32257e2956?source=post_page-----065695c17e82---------------------------------------)\nI recommend you _\u2014 of course -_ to read that __ first ;)\nBut here\u2019s a short introduction anyway\n### What is Asynchrony & Parallelism?\nLet\u2019s first define each term separately\n* **Synchronous**\nEach task must complete before the next one starts.\n* **Asynchronous (one thread)**\nA single thread handles multiple tasks by switchin...\n[Content truncated]\n",
